Given Theme:

The technology industry has a significant impact on the environment, with software development being one of the biggest contributors. The growing demand for technology has led to an increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions, which have adverse effects on the environment. Green software is a new approach to software development that aims to reduce the environmental impact of technology.

The challenge is to build intelligent tools and frameworks that will guide and enable developers and the larger tech community to design and build green code. These tools and frameworks should be intuitive and provide developers with recommendations and best practices to reduce carbon footprint spanning the entire software development life cycle (SDLC).

Problem Definition: 

The carbon emission from industries is a biggest concern for environment in terms of pollution of air, water and energy.

Possible Solutions:

we are building a software solution to the problem definition by developing a softwarer of Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning Algorithm
that is intelligent enough in detecting carbon emission or carbon content in air after the release of carbon from industries needs to be calculated
by capturing an image of industry emission. This requires an Algorithm that detects the percentage of carbon particles present in released carbon emission into air. 
Therefore, we are dewveloping an AI/ML Alogrithm that detects and predicts the carbon emission from industries. 
Furthermore, focuses on precentage of carbon particles present in carbon emission with the help of software developed from a designed algorithm.

Conclusion:

By incorporating this Green Softweare into an Electronics, we may be able to use these products in real-time for detection and prediction of carbon particles. Thereby, the 
prototype model may be used in place to assess the percentage of carbon particles present in an emitted carbon dioxide. 
This paves an important benchmark solution as an alternative to the existing conventional approach
